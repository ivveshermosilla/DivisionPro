**DivisionPro** is a comprehensive educational web application built to help students master the long division process through an interactive, visual, and highly structured experience. 

## 👨‍👩‍👦 The Inspiration Behind the Project
This project is deeply personal. It was fueled by the learning journey of **my 10-year-old son**, who has been the true engine and primary "beta tester" for these modules. His curiosity and need for clear mathematical structures inspired me to create tools that support his growth and development in mathematics.

DivisionPro is the direct successor to [**MatPro**](https://github.com/ivveshermosilla/matpro-triple-method), a previous module we developed to help him master multiplication tables using the "Triple Method." Once that foundation was solid, **DivisionPro** was born to cement his long division skills by applying everything learned in the previous stage.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **🎓 Guided Mode (Learn to Divide)**: A step-by-step assisted system that prevents common errors and teaches the "Select-Divide-Subtract-Bring Down" cycle.
* **🚀 Pro Mode (DivisionPro)**: Independent practice with advanced aids like visual highlighting and a smart scratchpad.
* **📊 Dual Grading System (V1.2.2)**: Performance evaluation tailored for both **USA (A-F)** and **Chile (1.0-7.0)** standards.
* **🌎 Multilingual Support**: Switch between English and Spanish seamlessly.

## 🛠️ Technical Overview
* **Logic**: Vanilla JavaScript with custom algorithms for division scaffolding.
* **Persistence**: LocalStorage for keeping track of progress and historical scores.
* **Design**: Pure HTML5/CSS3 focused on a distraction-free environment for students.

## 📈 Future Roadmap
DivisionPro is a living project. Future updates will focus on:
* **Advanced Analytics**: Deeper insights for tutors to identify specific learning gaps.
* **New Game Modes**: Expanding to decimal divisions and advanced remainders.
* **MatPro Integration**: Better synergy between the multiplication and division modules.
